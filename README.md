To be honest, I just think that a lot of GitHub activity in my profile looks cool. But I'm lazy to commit stuff everyday, so this script is taking charge of that. It might even give me some nerdy facts to share. You will see that the API is quite crappy as well, but it suffices for this lil project. Who knows... Well, here they go!
